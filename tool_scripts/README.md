## Bash scripts for NetMHCpan-(4.0 & 4.1), NetMHCIIpan-4.0 and GibbsCluster-2.0

The scripts provided by DTU Health Tech to run NetMHCpan-(4.0 & 4.1), NetMHCIIpan-4.0 and GibbsCluster-2.0 are
`tcsh` scripts. Some newer operating systems do not include `tcsh` by default, so to make the installation of 
MhcVizPipe as simple (and sudo-free) as possible we translated these scripts into Bash scipts which should work on
nearly any system.
