# NOTE: the paths to netMHCpan, netMHCIIpan and gibbscluster will usually be the default values if you have
# followed the installation instructions that come with those softwares. If you have a more custom setup, e.g. multiple
# versions or the programs are not in your PATH, then you might need to edit these values.
#
# The temp folder is up to you. /tmp gets cleared out occasionally on most systems (e.g. on restart), so if you want
# to keep the temporary files indefinitely you should change this to something else, e.g. somewhere in you home
# directory.
#
# "motifs" must be one of "kullback-leibler" or "shannon"
# "hobohm clustering" tells PlotlyLogo whether to perform clustering on the sequence alignments (i.e. weighting)
# "clustering threshold" is the similarity cutoff for Hobohm clustering (0.63 is a commonly used value)
# "weight on prior" is the weight on pseudo counts. Set to 0 to turn off pseudo counts.
#
# HOSTNAME and PORT are where you will connect to the app (i.e. the website). If you are not setting MVP up to
# run on a server, you can most likely leave these as the default values. If you are setting it up on a server for
# distributed use, you probably already know what you are doing here. Honestly, if you are setting this up in a
# distributed environment, you should probably set up the server yourself and not rely on the MVP.py script to
# start it.
#
# TIMEOUT is the number of seconds before gunicorn raises a WORKER TIMEOUT error. The default is 1 hour, though this
# much time will almost never be needed.
