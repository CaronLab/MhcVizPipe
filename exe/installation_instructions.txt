This will guide you on how to install the standalone distribution of MhcVizPipe.

You must first download NetMHCpan, NetMHCIIpan and GibbsCluster. If you have not yet downloaded
these files, see the instructions here:
https://github.com/CaronLab/MhcVizPipe/wiki/Downloading-third-party-software

NOTE: You don't need to do a full installation of these tools for MhcVizPipe to work. However,
it would be a good idea to install them at some point because MhcVizPipe does not show the full
output of the tools, and you will want to run the tools yourself for experiments such as mining
peptide lists for novel motifs. When you are ready, you can follow our installation instructions
for the tools: https://github.com/CaronLab/MhcVizPipe/wiki/Installation-of-third-party-software.md


--- Installation ---

1. Download MhcVizPipe (https://github.com/CaronLab/MhcVizPipe/releases)
   (choose the download which is appropriate for your operating system, i.e. either MacOS or Linux).

2. Extract the archive to a location of your choosing. This should create a folder called `MhcVizpipe`

3. Inside the `MhcVizPipe` folder, you should find a folder called `tools` in which there will be a few files.

   i.  Into this `tools` folder extract the archives for NetMHCpan, NetMHCIIpan and GibbsCluster.

   ii. There should now be three
   additional folders: `gibbscluster-2.0`, `netMHCIIpan-4.0`, and `netMHCpan-4.0` or `netMHCpan-4.1`.

4. Now try running MhcVizPipe by double-clicking the `MhcVizPipe` executable file in the `MhcVizPipe` folder.

    i. A terminal window should appear and the executable will start to download some required data files for
    NetMHCpan and NetMHCIIpan

    ii. If there are any issues with the download, an error message will appear that will tell you
    how to download the files yourself and where to put them.

    iii. Once the downloads are complete, a welcome message should appear. You will find a URL link in the message. To
       start the MhcVizPipe GUI, right-click the link or copy-paste it into your web browser.

5. Now you should be seeing MhcVizPipe for the first time.
    - If you want, you can bookmark the page that is running MVP. It will be the same address every
    time you start the program unless you or someone else changes the server parameters in the settings.
