# Example Datasets

`S1_All_data.xlsx` contains all datasets used in the MhcVizPipe publication.

The subdirectories contain individual files for all the peptides lists in `S1_All_data.xlxs`.

Note that MhcVizPipe will not open XLSX
files. To use these datasets you may copy and paste the peptide lists from the xlsx file into MVP or you may directly
load the individual files for each peptide list in the labeled subdirectories.
